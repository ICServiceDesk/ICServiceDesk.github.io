# Welcome back!
I hope you all had a restful break. While most of you were sleeping till noon and ignoring your parent's subtle pleas to cook _them_ a dinner for once, some enterprising and ambitious students were hard at work at the Service Desk accomplishing more than I really thought we could!

## TDX Beautification
What words come to mind when I say "Teamdynamix"? Boring? Drab? Mundane? Prosaic? Banal? Well, no more!
David, Garen, and Ikrom have poured their souls into making TDX a place that shows off IC's natural beauty and embraces the bucolic surrounding of our little home away from home. Upon opening [help.ithaca.edu](https://help.ithaca.edu) you will now be greeted by the sweeping green slopes of our practice fields and the lake beyond, the floral gardens so lovingly maintained, and the cerulean waters of the majestic fountains. It makes you want to sing ðŸŽµ"Ithaca, forever shine your light on me,
in my heart together we shall always be"ðŸŽµ

Please thank them when you see them. They have truly left an indelible mark on IT with this. I'll attach pictures below for your enjoyment.

## Magical Forms, oh my!
Josh, also, was fastened to the desk and furiously typing, brow firmly furrowed. He forged new forms most fondly. Fair, my fellow to figure for what this form facilitates. Forsooth, fathom no further. For he has faceted field after field to fabricate a form most fabled. Find this form, friend, festooned [here]. Frankly, I'm fully flabbergasted at his fortitude. He fights with a fiery furor that flumoxes me as he makes, in fact, fifteen fifty. Thanks F'Josh!
