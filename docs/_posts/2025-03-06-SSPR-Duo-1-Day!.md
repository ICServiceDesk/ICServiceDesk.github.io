# 1 day response window
We are changing from a 3 business day to a 1 business day response time for SSPR and Duo tickets. This is all an effort to reduce the amount of tickets sitting in the queue. The logic is that if a user isn't responding to getting access to their account, how urgent is it? Everything else stays the same when it comes to closing and how we respond.
