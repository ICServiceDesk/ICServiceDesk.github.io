## Intercom changes TONIGHT!
Intercom will now be behind a login screen. Only current students, faculty, staff, and affiliates will be able to view it. Retirees will as well, but not alumni. Review the Intercom article in the Teams General chat for more info. Be prepared for an influx of SSPR and DUO requests as people who have never had to sign in will now have to.
