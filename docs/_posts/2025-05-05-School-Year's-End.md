# Prologue
Howdy, friends ðŸ¤ 
I'm so proud of your work these last two semesters. One of the joys of my job is to watch you grow and succeed. I know it seems trvial or prosaic work that anyone could do. But I don't see it that way. You all achieve so much and are, in my eyes, building a solid foundation for your careers in the future.

# Goodbye, I guess.
Seniors, congratulations and I wish you all the best. I have no doubt that all of you will succeed and thrive. SD grads have a practically 100% job placement rate out of school. Worst case, you have IT has a fallback. You are a valuable asset now. You are graduating with a degree _and_ a technology toolbox. How many of your friends and peers have that same level of technicality? If you ever need recommendations, advice, or reassurance, reach out. Both Donavan and I are here to help you guys. If you want my phone number or anything to keep in touch, I'd be happy to give it to you. I'm also on Telegram and Matrix.

Returners, you guys _wish_ you were the graduating seniors. Unless you're Josh I guess. Have you seen those guys? ELITE. I'm not saying you guys _can't_ achieve what they did, but it'll be work. I think you can get there though. You guys have a lot of potential in your tummies. Make sure you say your goodbyes to those that are leaving. Those include: Mara, David, Stella, Hadil, Ikrom, Brian, Hermela, Jake, etc. These are also amazing resources to contact once you begin your own graduation journey.

# Work stuff now!
### Smarthub return apocalypse
I will be leaving on the 9th for a 10 day trip. This means that I will possibly miss you guys as you leave campus. That's a bummer.

That being said, end of year means Smarthub returns! Oh man, oh boy, here it comes. I will be gone for that. I am relying on you guys to take ownership and total control of that process. It is of high importance we recover those devices.

The laptops are almost universally due May 14th by 5pm. This is the day after finals. I'm a little nervous, ngl (not gonna lie). Before I leave, I will be sending out an email to every student who has a loan reminding them. This will come from my own email address. As we enter the week of the 14th, set aside proper space to receive the computers. I usually tape off an area to delineate computers that are dropped off, computers that have been dropped off and returned, and computers that are dropped off, returned and wiped.

Please be very cognizant of what you are doing. Messing this up could literally cost students. Make sure to be diligent!

David, Jake, Ikrom, Hadil, Hermela, Joshua, and Garen. Take special note of the above. You all are working that day and will be handling all of this. Think of and devise some strategies in order to make that all come together.
