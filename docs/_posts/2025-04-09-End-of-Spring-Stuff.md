Everyone! Isn't this RSS feed nifty?
# First!

## ðŸšœ Y'all better read Hadil's post
She worked very hard on it and you owe her. [Annoucement!](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:621d99492590415c9db1f5c8f4284832@thread.skype/1744145558844?tenantId=fa1ac8f6-5e54-4857-9f0b-4aa422c09689&groupId=32cbcebf-fc7b-4909-a75a-40b7122e30c9&parentMessageId=1744145558844&teamName=IT%20Service%20Desk&channelName=Desk%20Announcements&createdTime=1744145558844&ngc=true)


# Second!

## ðŸš— It's coming up on the end of tax season!
and fresh alumni may still need to access Homer for tax info!
Here are some quick directions to guide students to their 1098-Ts:
- Log into HomerConnect
- Click on "Billing and Payment" in the sidebar
- Click "Tax Notification (1098-T)"

Also, take advantage of the Tax Clinics that Ben is offering in conjunction with Kari Smoker! 


# Third!

## ðŸš’ Smarthub is slipping! 
Gamers, please please make sure that we are returning things in Smarthub. There have been many times now where I have seen us not return or not loan things properly. We have to be better. Please reach out to the person sitting next to you for help if you're unsure.Remember that student chargers are only a 1 day loan!

# Fourth, and final

## ðŸš• Please refer to the previous desk announcement
about new student registration. Some of you definitely have not looked at that file I linked. Look at this image! See anything wrong? Why is it wrong?

I'm still finding hundreds, maybe thousands, of new student tickets without any tagging.

### Why not read this short blog post? 
We can argue about it next shift if you want...
